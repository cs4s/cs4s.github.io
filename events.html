          <h2>Term 2 Professional Learning for Stage 3 Teachers</h2>
          <p>
            We are planning to run a professional learning program for Stage 3 teachers over Term 2 this year.
            The program would involve weekly after-school sessions, 2 hours in duration, which will be held at a computer lab at the University of Newcastle's Callaghan Campus.
          </p>
          <p>The program will involve:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>an introduction to Coding and Computational Thinking</li>
            <li>activities that demonstrate how to integrate these skills across the different Key Learning Areas</li>
            <li>opportunities for self-reflection and collaboration with other teachers and university researchers</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The program will be <strong>free</strong> and accredited with the New South Wales Education Standards Authority (NESA) for <strong>30 hours of professional learning</strong>. The program will address the following standards at the Proficient level: 2.6.2, 3.3.2, 3.4.2, 4.5.2, 6.2.2, 6.4.2.
          </p>
