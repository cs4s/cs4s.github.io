[CS4S: Developing Coding Hubs Workshop](https://sites.google.com/view/hubs2018)                           |  A workshop for teachers to learn about how to run their own *professional learning events* that are related to the teaching of *coding* and *computational thinking*.                                                                                                                                                                       |  November, 2018
[CS4S: An Introduction to Coding and Computational Thinking Workshop](http://127.0.0.1:4000/intro-2018/)  |  Introduced fundamental *computational concepts* with a variety of tools and resources, such as [Lightbot](https://lightbot.com/) and [PencilCode](http://pencilcode.net/).                                                                                                                                                                  |  July, 2018
[Coding in Stage 3: Coding & STEAM](/2018/steam)                                                          |   A weekly after-school program that ran for 10 weeks and that involved learning about ways of integrating coding into a variety of learning areas. This program mainly involved using [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) and activities adapted from the [Creative Computing Curriculum Guide](http://scratched.gse.harvard.edu/guide/).   |  May - August 2018
[Coding in Stage 3: ScratchMaths](/2018/maths)                                                            |  A weekly after-school program that ran for 10 weeks and that focused on how coding can be integrated into Stage 3 Mathematics. This program used materials that were adapted from the [UCL ScratchMaths curriculum materials](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/ioe/research/projects/scratchmaths/ucl-scratchmaths-curriculum).                        |  May - August 2018
