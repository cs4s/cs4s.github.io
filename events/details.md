#### Coding & STEAM Program (Ran during Term 3 2019)
{: .program-details-header}

This program focused on using [Scratch 3](https://scratch.mit.edu/) for teaching Coding, but the program also included some opportunities to learn about other Coding languages and tools, such as [Microbits](https://microbit.org/).

This program was best suited for teachers of Stage 3 classes implementing the new Science and Technology K-6 syllabus. However, the program was open to all primary school staff, including but not limited to RFF teachers, STEM specialists and teacher-librarians. The program’s activities were adapted from the Creative Computing Curriculum Guide, as these activities can be easily adapted for varying levels of Coding experience. We mapped the activities to outcomes of different K-6 Key Learning Areas (including Creative Arts, English and Mathematics), as well as the relevant AITSL Teacher Standards, ACARA General Capabilities and ACARA Digital Technologies content descriptors.

The Coding & STEAM program ran over 8 weeks during Term 3 of 2019 (Weeks 2 – 9). The program involved weekly after-school 2-hour tutorial sessions at the University of Newcastle’s Callaghan campus and a weekly homework task that each took around 1-2 hours to complete. The program was accredited with NESA for 32 hours for the following teaching standards at the Proficient level: 2.1.2, 2.6.2, 3.3.2, 3.4.2, 4.5.2, 6.2.2 and 6.4.2.

#### Introductory Workshop (10th and 11th of October 2019)
{: .program-details-header}

If you would like some help getting started learning and teaching Coding and Computational Thinking, then this workshop is for you. This workshop’s content will be most useful for teachers that are beginning to teach concepts in the Digital Technologies strand of the new Science and Technology K-6 syllabus and Digital Technologies context of the new Technology Mandatory Years 7-8 syllabus. However, Primary and High School educators that teach any Stage in K-12, and with any amount of experience teaching Coding and Computational Thinking, are welcome to attend this workshop. 

The workshop’s activities will be very practical and mainly involve using [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/), which is a free visual programming language that is commonly used for teaching Coding and Computational Thinking at all levels of K-12. However, the concepts that will be taught during the workshop (for example: algorithms, sequencing, branching and iteration) are essential Computational Thinking concepts that are in the Technology Mandatory and Science and Technology syllabuses, and these concepts will be applicable to all Coding languages.

This workshop will emphasise Coding and Computational Thinking as skills that can help you address [ACARA’s General Capabilities](https://www.australiancurriculum.edu.au/f-10-curriculum/general-capabilities/), including Critical and Creative Thinking. Free teaching resources that are focused on problem-solving and creativity in Scratch, such as the [Creative Computing curriculum guide](http://scratched.gse.harvard.edu/guide/), will be shared throughout the workshop.

The workshop will also include several activities that integrate Coding and Computational Thinking with a variety of Key Learning Areas, such as Science and Mathematics. These activities will utilise and expand on many of the resources and suggestions in the [NESA's Digital Technologies and ICT Resources Guide](http://educationstandards.nsw.edu.au/wps/portal/nesa/k-10/learning-areas/technologies/coding-across-the-curriculum). This workshop will be run over two days at the University of Newcastle’s Callaghan campus and will be accredited with NESA for 12 hours for the following teaching standards at the Proficient level: 2.1, 2.6, 3.3, 3.4, 4.5, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 6.2 and 6.4.

Sessions in this workshop will include:

- A session that involves activities that can be used to teach Computational Thinking without using a computer (unplugged activities)
- An overview of different beginner-friendly languages and resources to help students move from blocks languages (e.g. Scratch) to text languages (e.g. Python)
- Hands-on activities with Microbits and Makey Makeys, where you will learn about Physical Computing

#### Developing Coding Hubs for Teachers Workshop (Planned for November/December 2019) 
{: .program-details-header}

If you are currently teaching Coding and Computational Thinking at your school and would like to run your own professional learning events to share your knowledge with your peers, then this workshop is for you. In this workshop, we will help you gather resources and organise Digital Technologies professional learning for other teachers at your school and/or in the professional learning communities you are part of.

This workshop will involve the sharing of existing resources, such as the [PL-in-a-Box materials](https://csermoocs.appspot.com/plbox/), that can be used in, and adapted for, your own professional learning events. There will also be presentations from professional learning organisers that can help you organise your own events, as well as activities in which you will plan and gather resources for these events, with assistance from the CS4S team. 

This workshop will be run over two days at the University of Newcastle’s Callaghan campus but you will also have the option to complete one of the workshop days online. The workshop will be accredited with NESA for 10 hours for the following teaching standards, at the Proficient level: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.6, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.6, 4.5, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4 and 7.4

#### AI and VR Workshops (Planned for November/December 2019)
{: .program-details-header}

If you are preparing to teach Artificial Intelligence and Virtual Reality within the Years 7-10 Information and Software Technology syllabus or Years 11-12 Software Design and Development syllabus, or you are a primary or high school teacher looking for project ideas to extend your high-achieving students, then these workshops are for you. You will have the option to choose to either attend both workshops or, if you are particularly interested in only one of the topic, to attend only one of the workshops.

We are still planning content and dates for the workshops, but we intend to run each workshop over one day, most likely on school days during Term 4. The workshops will be very practical and will involve completing a project that addresses outcomes from the new topic areas in the syllabus that is set to replace the Years 7–10 Information and Software Technology syllabus. We are planning to create examples of AI and VR projects that are accessible for a variety of students’ skill levels and that can be completed using free/low-cost hardware and software.

Registration has not opened for these workshops yet, but you can express your interest in participating in the workshops and suggest any other areas you would like to see us cover in the workshops by completing [this form](https://forms.gle/874cYsVnU8HwTqGc9).
