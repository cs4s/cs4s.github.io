### Program Details

#### Introduction to Coding &amp; Computational Thinking Workshop (July 19th and 20th 2018)
{: .program-details-header}

If you have heard about Coding and Computational Thinking and would like to start learning and teaching these skills, or if you have just started to learn these skills and are looking for some more help and resources, then this workshop is for you. 
**Primary and High School educators that teach any Stage in K-12** are welcome to attend this workshop.

The workshop’s activities will mainly involve using [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/), which is a free visual programming language that is commonly used for teaching Coding at all levels of K-12. 
However, the concepts that will be taught during the workshop (for example: *algorithms*, *sequencing*, *branching* and *iteration*) are essential Coding concepts and will be applicable to all programming languages.

This workshop will emphasise Coding and Computational Thinking as skills that can help your students learn [ACARA’s General Capabilities](https://www.australiancurriculum.edu.au/f-10-curriculum/general-capabilities/), including Critical and Creative Thinking. 
Free teaching resources that are focused on problem-solving and creativity in Scratch, such as the [Creative Computing curriculum guide](http://scratched.gse.harvard.edu/guide/), will be shared throughout the workshop.

The workshop will also include several activities that integrate Coding and Computational Thinking with a variety of Key Learning Areas, such as Science and Mathematics. 
These activities will utilise and expand on many of the resources and suggestions in the [NSW Education Standard Authority’s (NESA) Coding Across the Curriculum Guide](http://educationstandards.nsw.edu.au/wps/portal/nesa/k-10/learning-areas/technologies/coding-across-the-curriculum).
This workshop will be run over two days at the University of Newcastle’s Callaghan campus and will be accredited with NESA for 12 hours for the following teaching standards at the Proficient level: 2.1, 2.6, 3.3, 3.4, 4.5, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 6.2 and 6.4.

Sessions in this workshop will include:

- A session that involves activities that can be used to teach Computational Thinking without using a computer (unplugged activities)
- An overview of different beginner-friendly languages and resources to help students move from blocks languages (e.g. Scratch) to text languages (e.g. Python)
- Hands-on activities with Microbits, where you will learn about Physical Computing

<u>Dates:</u> July 19th and July 20th 2018

#### Developing Coding Hubs for Teachers Workshop (Planned for October/November 2018)
{: .program-details-header}
        
If you are currently teaching Coding and Computational Thinking and would like to run your own professional learning events for teaching these skills, then this workshop is for you. In this workshop, we will help you gather resources and organise Digital Technologies professional learning for other teachers at your school and/or in the professional learning communities you are part of.

This workshop will involve the sharing of existing resources, such as the [PL-in-a-Box materials](https://csermoocs.appspot.com/plbox/), that can be used in, and adapted for, your own professional learning events. 
There will also be presentations from professional learning organisers that can help you organise your own events, as well as activities in which you will plan and gather resources for these events, with assistance from the CS4S team. 
There will also be a session that includes examples of approaches for evaluating the success of the professional learning programs you run.

This workshop will be run over two days at the University of Newcastle’s Callaghan campus and will be accredited with NESA for 12 hours for the following teaching standards, at the Proficient level: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.6, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.6, 4.5, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4 and 7.4

Following the workshop, the CS4S team will assist you in the development and running of a professional learning session in your school or professional community.
