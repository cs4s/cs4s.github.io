## 2019 Professional Learning Programs

### About

In 2019, the Newcastle CS4S team will run three different professional learning programs, free for teachers to attend, at the University of Newcastleâ€™s Callaghan campus. These programs will be accredited with the NSW Education Standards Authority (NESA). The four programs that will be run are the:

- **Coding & STEAM Program** (ran during Term 3)
- **Introduction to Coding and Computational Thinking Workshop** (10th and 11th of October)
- **AI and VR Workshops** (Planned for November/December)

For more information about each of the programs, please see the *Program Details* section below. 

For some quick guidance about which of the programs you would be suited to attend, see the *Which Program/s Should I Participate in?* section below.

All of the programs are focused on developing competencies included in the Digital Technologies learning area of the national Australian Curriculum and the capabilities outlined in the [NESA's Digital Technologies and ICT Resources Guide](http://educationstandards.nsw.edu.au/wps/portal/nesa/k-10/learning-areas/technologies/coding-across-the-curriculum). The CS4S workshops have been developed in [partnership with Google](https://edu.google.com/computer-science/educator-grants/#?modal_active=none).

You can register for the Introduction workshop running in October by [completing this online form](https://forms.gle/m4Zqdbua1m5sdZxF7).
We have not opened registration for the *AI/VR Workshops* yet.
However, you can express your interest in participating in those workshops by [completing this form here](https://forms.gle/874cYsVnU8HwTqGc9) and we will contact you once registration for these workshops open.

### Which Program/s Should I Participate in?

The details of each program are explained in the *Program Details* section below, but we have also included a quick explanation of the programs we recommend that you attend here.

- If you are completely new to Coding or are just beginning to learn Coding, we recommend that you attend the *Introductory Workshop*
- If you are teaching Stage 3 classes (including RFF, as a STEM specialist, or as a teacher-librarian) and you are planning to teach Coding with Scratch, we recommend that you attend the *Coding & STEAM* program. This program is for teachers with all levels of experience teaching Coding
- If you are looking for project ideas that cover outcomes related to Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Virtual Reality (VR) in the changing *Information and Software Technology and Software Design and Development syllabuses*, or would like to learn about projects that could extend your high-achieving students, we recommend that you attend one or both of the AI/VR workshops
