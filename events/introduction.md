## 2019 Professional Learning Programs

### About

In 2019, the Newcastle CS4S team will run four different professional learning programs, free for teachers to attend, at the University of Newcastleâ€™s Callaghan campus. These programs will be accredited with the NSW Education Standards Authority (NESA). The four programs that will be run are the:

- **Coding & STEAM Program** (ran during Term 3)
- **Introduction to Coding and Computational Thinking Workshop** (10th and 11th of October)
- **AI and VR Workshops** (Planned for November/December)
- **Developing Coding Hubs for Teachers Workshop** (Planned for November/December)

For more information about each of the programs, please see the *Program Details* section below. 

For some quick guidance about which of the programs you would be suited to attend, see the *Which Program/s Should I Participate in?* section below.

All of the programs are focused on developing competencies included in the Digital Technologies learning area of the national Australian Curriculum and the capabilities outlined in the [NESA's Digital Technologies and ICT Resources Guide](http://educationstandards.nsw.edu.au/wps/portal/nesa/k-10/learning-areas/technologies/coding-across-the-curriculum). The CS4S workshops have been developed in [partnership with Google](https://edu.google.com/computer-science/educator-grants/#?modal_active=none).

You can register for the Introduction workshop running in October by [completing this online form](https://forms.gle/m4Zqdbua1m5sdZxF7).
We have not opened registration for the *AI/VR Workshop* and *Developing Coding Hubs for Teachers Workshop* yet.
However, you can express your interest in participating in those workshops by [completing this form here](https://forms.gle/874cYsVnU8HwTqGc9) and we will contact you once registration for these programs open.

If you have any questions about the 2019 CS4S programs, please contact [Daniel Hickmott](mailto:daniel.hickmott@uon.edu.au?Subject=CS4S%20PD%20Query).

### Which Program/s Should I Participate in?

The details of each program are explained in the *Program Details* section below, but we have also included a quick explanation of the programs we recommend that you attend here.

- If you are completely new to Coding or are just beginning to learn Coding, we recommend that you attend the *Introductory Workshop*
- If you are teaching Stage 3 classes (including RFF, as a STEM specialist, or as a teacher-librarian) and you are planning to teach Coding with Scratch, we recommend that you attend the *Coding & STEAM* program. This program is for teachers with all levels of experience teaching Coding
- If you are looking for project ideas that cover outcomes related to Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Virtual Reality (VR) in the changing *Information and Software Technology and Software Design and Development syllabuses*, or would like to learn about projects that could extend your high-achieving students, we recommend that you attend one or both of the AI/VR workshops
- If you have attended one of our programs before or have a few years of experience teaching Coding and Computational Thinking already, and would like to learn about the approaches you can use for sharing your expertise with your peers, we recommend that you participate in the *Developing Coding Hubs for Teachers* short course

You are welcome to express your interest in multiple programs in the year. For example, you could participate in the *Coding & STEAM* program or *Introductory workshop* to familiarise yourself with Coding and Computational Thinking, and then, later in the year, participate in the *Developing Coding Hubs for Teachers workshop* to learn more about spreading this knowledge with your colleagues.
