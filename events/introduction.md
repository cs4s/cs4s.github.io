## 2018 Professional Learning Workshops

### About

In 2018, the Newcastle CS4S team will run two different professional learning workshops, which are both free for teachers to attend and are accredited with the NSW Education Standards Authority (NESA). The two workshops being run are the:

- *Introduction to Coding and Computational Thinking Workshop* **(July 19th and 20th)**
- *Developing Coding Hubs for Teachers Workshop* **(planned for October/November)**

For more information about the differences between these workshops, please see the *Program Details* section below.

The two professional learning workshops are focused on developing competencies included in the Digital Technologies learning area of the national Australian Curriculum and the capabilities outlined in the [NSW Coding and Computational Thinking Across the Curriculum Guide](http://educationstandards.nsw.edu.au/wps/portal/nesa/k-10/learning-areas/technologies/coding-across-the-curriculum).
The CS4S workshops have been developed [in partnership with Google](https://edu.google.com/computer-science/educator-grants/#?modal_active=none).
